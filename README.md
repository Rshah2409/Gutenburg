How to clean text data and convert into dataframes.
Firstly, I imported libraries and prnting the fileids of gutenberg dataset which was followed by downloading one book named bryant-stories from gutenburg as a dataset.
After that, cleaned the text data. For, cleaning the data I perform the following steps:
1) Printing the stopwords.
2) Converting into lower text.
3) Removing punctuation.
4) Removing digits.
5) Removing whitespace.
6) Removing the stopwords.
So, now whatever we have it is as a cleaned data.
In the next step, I converted the text data into dataframes. After that, I created 200 sample partitions and make sure each partition or record has 100 words.
